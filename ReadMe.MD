# PassGen
An VERY SIMPLE password generator made in Python. 🐍
This project was made in around 30 minutes by just using my brain. 🧠
It works by simply having a couple variables. It contains uppercase and lowercase numbers,
symbols and numbers. Then it randomizes all of that and gives it in an output. ➕
THIS. REQUIRES. ATLEAST. PYTHON. 2.7
I don't have the brain to compile it into an EXE, even with all the YouTube tutorials.
